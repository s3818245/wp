          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>Yes, I have a little experience with HTML from my ICT class in highschool and I had an opportunity to work with website from my Intro to IT class. Overall, I'm still new to coding and there are still many aspects of web 
            designing that I still need to learn.

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>Nowadays, websites are ubiquitous due to their quick accessibility and ease to use. They have become an indespensible part of our daily lives and can be used for many different purposes and scenarios. With that said, I think that
            being able to build a website would be a very useful skill that would support me in the future.</p> </div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>

          <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>

            collaborative and supportive.
